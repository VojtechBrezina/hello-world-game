# hello_world

A short little game written in Godot, that tries
to stay as basic as possible.

## Features

### Mouse only controls

You don't even worry about mapping any keys and
I don't have to worry about making any UI to
explain them to you. You just move your mouse
around. It doesn't even use the right mouse button.

### A narator

Just a few lines of text to keep you company
and question your life decisions.

### An automated save mechanism

In case you *really* want to start another session
for some reason...
